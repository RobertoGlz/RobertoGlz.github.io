Things I enjoy
======
Since I was very little I have always loved watching and playing football (soccer). I started enjoying baseball a while ago and overall I consider myself a sports fan.
I enjoy having a good _choripán_ or _bratwurst_ and _alfajores_ & _apfelstrudel_ are my absolute favourite desserts.

Educational Background
======
I am a M.Sc. in Economic Theory student at ITAM (2022-2024) in Mexico City. 
I am a Pre-doctoral Research Fellow at Michigan State University and the Center for Economic Research at ITAM since August 2023.
I was a Research Assistant at the Center for Economic Research at ITAM from August 2020 to July 2023. 
I currently hold a BA in Economics (ITAM, 2022).

Research Interests
======
I consider myself a Development Economist and I like to dig into Applied Microeconomics as well as Causal Inference & Applied Microeconometrics methods.
My research agenda is perhaps not very well defined as of now but, in general, I am concerned with development topics such as poverty traps and the way institutions foster or hinder development.
