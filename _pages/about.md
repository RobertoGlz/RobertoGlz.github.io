I am a M.Sc. in Economic Theory student at ITAM (2022-2024) in Mexico City. My main interests are development economics, causal inference and applied micro. I'm also a Research Assistant at the Center for Economic Research (CIE) at ITAM since 2020. I currently hold a BA in Economics (ITAM, 2022).

My research agenda comprises (but is not limited to) development topics such as health, education and nutrition. I am also interested in poverty traps, political econ and labour markets. I mainly focus on empirical work but enjoy working on theory as well.

Within my webpage you can find my [CV](https://robertoglz.github.io/files/gonzalezroberto_cv.pdf), Working Papers and teaching materials.

Please, feel free to contact me if thereÂ´s anything I may help you with.
