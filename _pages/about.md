### Things I enjoy

Since I was very young I have always loved watching and playing football (soccer). I started enjoying baseball a while ago and overall I consider myself a sports fan.
I enjoy having a good _choripán_ or _bratwurst_ and _alfajores_ & _apfelstrudel_ are my absolute favourite desserts.

### Educational Background

I am a M.Sc. in Economic Theory student at ITAM (2022-2024) in Mexico City. 

I currently hold a BA in Economics (ITAM, 2022). You can look at my undergrad thesis exploring the effects of Seguro Popular on mortality [here](https://robertoglz.github.io/files/tesis_BA_RobertoGonzalez.pdf).

### Research Interests

I am interested in Development Economics, Economics of Education, Applied Econometrics, Political Economy and Health.

Within my webpage you can find my [Research](https://robertoglz.github.io/research), [CV](https://robertoglz.github.io/files/robertogonzalez_cv.pdf), and [Teaching materials](https://robertoglz.github.io/teaching).
